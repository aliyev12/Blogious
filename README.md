# Blogious

This is a blog app that allows users to post blogs with images.
The app is built with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and Semantic UI. Some of the additional technologies used to build this app are Mongoose - to enable MongoDB in JavaScript, and Sanitize Express - to sanitize user input in order to prevent malicious activity.
In order to use/deploy the app, you would need to create an .env file based on .env.default prototype, and provide IP address, port number as well as MongoDB username, password, and database name in it. Note: DotEnv install is aready specified in package.json.
